# Getting Started with Jessica Nelson's Website

This project was created with [Create React App](https://https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `Start server`

Type json-server -p 3001 --watch db.json in the terminal to start the json server.

### `Navigating the app`

This site uses the hooks useEffect and useState. It also uses BrowserRouter as Router from react-router-dom and uses three routes to navigate to various components. NavLink is also imported from react-router-dom.

### `Components`
There are five components:
Home: introduces user to author and imports the Links component so that users can find the author on social media
NavBar: this component titles the page and uses NavLink


Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
